# Travelling Salesman Problem solved with Simulated Annealing in Python

This is something I did for my Complex System course.

Everything is done with the distances dictionary and the start variable, change it if you want a different problem.

You can also change the T and alpha parameters for other types of search.

It works by switching randomly cities in the path, validating that the new path is actually possible. Probably something better could be done there.
